The tools i used was all lot of things but first midjourney. Its an app that has images of items and other living things, things, aniamls, etc...  you can also design what picture you want an its only 20% off!Midjourney is quite low and anyone can use it to generate real-looking images within a matter of minutes. The results can range from uncanny to visually stunning, depending on the prompt.<br/><br/>
Another tool i used was Dall e, simply you can just search smething you describe it well, and the picture will soon appear. DALL-E is an artificial intelligence model that can generate images when you feed it textual descriptions. To accomplish this, it translates billions of text bits from the internet into an abstraction of stored information, which it then uses as a reference tool of describable things for generating those images. And there are all lot of different funtions, it can create item images, stories, and it shows information about products and companies. And more.<br/><br/>
Lastly Items.Design:Ai design assests.Its a realistic tool that can generate item images, it is a  digital resource that are created or used in the design process. Abstract backgrounds, shapes, images, real objects and much more to choose from. And fun fact, most of them are free!
