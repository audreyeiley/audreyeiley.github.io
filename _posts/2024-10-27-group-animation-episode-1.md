So there is a evil gummy bear who name is swagger. He posiened the river and the foodvengers are shocked because Swagger was one of their best friends. So Applestream alrets everybody by traveling to the lounge. They arrive back at the lake. Glazed Guardian and Agent gummy bear was holding swagger. Swagger still had the potion. So Glazed guardian and Supa Avocado went to the sky, they called for the legendary frosted boba. Suddenly Frosted boba appeared cheerfully. They went back to the lake. Frosted boba quikly had a potion to clean the waters. Then they kicked Swagger out. Finally, Happy land was clean and safe again.

 The role of Applestream is to get the foodvengers and capture "the" swagger.

The skills I used was coding and designing.

Our Strengh is that our animation is filled with exciting and funny stuff.
And our characters are unique and entertaining in their own way.

Our weakness is that our music those not fit in with the animation. And we added less sound effects than the other animations.
