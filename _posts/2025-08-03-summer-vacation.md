# My Summer Vacation

## 1. JMK Program with Friends
During the summer, I joined **JMK** with my friends.  
JMK was a program offering various classes, such as reading, grammar, and more.  
Each class challenged me to learn new things, and I truly enjoyed the variety of subjects.

One of the best parts was learning alongside my friend **Celine**.  
Having her there created a **fun and welcoming environment**.  
We helped each other with assignments, shared ideas, and encouraged each other when things got tough.  

The **teachers** were supportive, patient, and always ready to help us understand challenging topics.  
Thanks to this positive atmosphere, I completed JMK without difficulties.  
By the end, I felt proud of how much I had learned.

## 2. Trip to America
I also had the chance to visit my friend in **America**.  
This was such a special trip â€” meeting someone from another country felt like a once-in-a-lifetime experience.  

From the moment I boarded the plane, I was filled with excitement.  
When I arrived, we jumped straight into having fun: playing games, exploring, and laughing together.

### Highlights of the Trip:
- **Water activities**: We rode a banana boat and other fun inflatable rides.
- **Water skiing**: At first, it seemed difficult, but surprisingly, my friend and I succeeded on our **first try**.  
  The sense of accomplishment was unforgettable.

This trip gave me memories I will cherish forever and reminded me how special it is to connect with friends, even across countries.

The camp was full of **fun activities** and teamwork.  
We played many games, and the light, exciting atmosphere made each day enjoyable.

Although the camp was a little easier than I expected, I still had a great time.  
It also gave me more opportunities to spend time with Celine, which made our friendship even stronger.
